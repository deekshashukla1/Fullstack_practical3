    <h3>About the Course</h3>
    <p>Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user
    interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and
        JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming.
        It encompasses everything form building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive
        HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via different browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
